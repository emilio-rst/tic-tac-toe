# tic-tac-toe

This is a Tic Tac Toe game on VueJS that I was required to develop on a assesment. Thus, I have taken the opportunity to share this on github.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
